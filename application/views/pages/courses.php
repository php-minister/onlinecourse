                <p>This course is especially designed for those who already know how to read Quran .If you don't know how to read Quran then you should take Quran Reading with Tajweed Classes before starting Translation classes.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the diploma course is the word to word translation of the Quran which the students learn thus enabling them to understand the entire Quran in the language chosen by ALLAH SWT. This method of learning has been devised personally by famous Islamic scholars who have endowed their students with this invaluable treasure. The sensation of being able to recite the Qur'an and understand it's meanings while reciting, without refer to translations, is a wondrous achievement in itself. </p>
